# Personal Timeline

This is a project to create a personal timeline (timeline of events in a person's life) using JavaScript timeline libraries.

It is intended to only be run locally, since I'm building this for myself, and I don't want this data to be in a database.

I'm not yet committed to a particular timeline library, so I'm formatting the data to work with multiple libaries (two, currently).

The source for the data will be a flat Excel file to allow to easy editing, without having to create a proper user interface.
